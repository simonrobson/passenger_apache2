  # This function takes a version string and returns the name of the directory
  # containing the build artifacts for that version.

  # Prior to version 4.9.1.beta, passenger put build artifacts into
  # a directory called 'ext'
  # From version 3.9.1.beta through version 4.0.5, the build artifacts
  # were put in 'libout', For some versions they seem not to be generated at all.
  # Since then, build artifacts are in 'buildout'

    # would break our comparison. So consider only first 3 parts of version.
